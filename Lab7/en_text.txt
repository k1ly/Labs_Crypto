The sun was setting over the horizon, casting a warm orange glow across the sky. The air was crisp and cool, with a gentle breeze blowing through the trees. Birds chirped in the distance as they settled in for the night. It was a peaceful evening, and the perfect time to take a relaxing stroll through the park.
