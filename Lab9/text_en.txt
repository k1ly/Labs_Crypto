Happiness is a complex and multi-dimensional emotion that is difficult to define and measure. However, it is generally understood as a positive emotional state characterized by feelings of pleasure, contentment, and satisfaction. Happiness is often associated with achieving goals, fulfilling desires, and experiencing positive events, but it can also be found in everyday moments and in simple pleasures.
Research has shown that happiness is strongly linked to social connections, such as spending time with loved ones, having a supportive community, and engaging in social activities. It is also associated with personal characteristics such as gratitude, optimism, resilience, and a sense of purpose.
